# Name: car.py
# Author: Olivia W., Casey C., Aiden L., Luna W. 
# Purpose: Contains all the necessary movement functions including forward, backwards, left, right, diagonal right, diagonal left, rotate left, rotate right, etc. Code uses the motor and time libraries.

# Name: buzzer2.py
# Author: Olivia W.
# Purpose: Concise file containing a for loop and buzzer library to activate the buzzer feature on the robot car

# Name: sense_obstacle.py
# Author: Casey C.
# Purpose: Python file utlizing the ultrasonic sensor via the ultrasonic library. Contains a while loop to detect distance to wall and breaks movement functions when in proximity.

# Name: camera1.py
# Author: Olivia W., Aiden L. 
# Purpose: Python file containing the camera library. Uses a for loop to print a 10 second countdown till the camera saves an image to a specific file name.

# Name: blckLine.py
# Author: Olivia W., Casey C., Aiden L., Luna W.
# Purpose: Practice file exercising with the infrared, motor, and time libraries. The file contains code that makes the robot car follow a black line with any type of curves, turns, etc.
